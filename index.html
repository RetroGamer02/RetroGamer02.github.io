		<h1>About My Github Projects</h1>
		<h2>GBAFreeDoom</h2>
		<p>Bringing FreeDoom to the Nintendo Gameboy Advanced based off the excellent work of DoomHack GBA port of prboom. 
		The project Consisted mostly of map and other resource editing not much focus on code due to again the fantastic work by Doomhack.</p>
		<p></p>
		<h2>Raptor Call of the Shadows</h2>
		<h3>Raptor Consoles</h3>
		<h4>Nintendo 3DS</h4>
		<p>Started as just a quick attempt to bring Raptor Call of the Shadows to the Nintendo 3DS. 
		I did this not only out of a love for the game but to get back into programming after a long hiatus. 
		The game turned into a much longer than expected project and learning experience. 
		I ended up running into a few major issues at first mostly dealing with memory alignment which I had no idea how to fix for a while. 
		After some time I started getting more comfortable with the Nintendo Handhelds and the ARM Arcatecture.</p>
		<h4>Microsoft Original Xbox</h4>
		<p>Raptor on the Original Xbox started with major problems due to quirks with NXDK. 
		The Xbox ports Test version had bad scaling, no music and a few other small bugs/speed issues, but it more or less ran.
		The Xbox port is currently in an early beta and has music, and less issues. 
		There is still currently a display issue where some text/dialog only displays for a second or two then vanishes.
		The issue is most noticeable in the Hanger and most annoyingly the Name/Callsign entry. 
		Needs to be fixed before I can consider the port properly playable.</p>

		<h3>RaptorGB</h3>
		<p>Started as a joke idea by Scott Bloom. 
		He then made a video showing the Raptor Title Screen with a fade sequence using I believe was GBDK.
		After some time I was looking to port Raptor to more Consoles and got started on an NDS Port which is still on my hardrive somewhere. 
		Somehow, me and Scott Bloom got talking about Raptor on the Gameboy.
		I ended up deciding to temporarily ditch the DS port in favor of working on demaking Raptor on the Gameboy with Scott Bloom.
		The GB port at the time of writing is mostly written from scratch out of necessity but has used at some points the Skynettx port as a reference on how things were done in the original.
		Again, at the time of writing I took a bit of a break to work on other things due to what I assume is burned out on RaptorGB.</p>
